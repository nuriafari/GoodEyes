# GoodEyes


## Inspiration
It is really easy to start getting too close to the screen without even realising. In this 22th century, where we are always in front of a computer, it is more important than ever to make sure we keep at a safe distance from the screen


## What it does
GoodEyes tracks the distance between your face and the screen, and pops up a message when you are more than 5 seconds close to the screen.

## How we built it
It is build with python, using the libraries, pygame and others
